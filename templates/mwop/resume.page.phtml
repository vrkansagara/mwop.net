                I am a software engineer and architect, PHP expert, standards
                developer, and product manager. I create the tools that PHP
                developers use to build and deploy their applications, from APIs
                to content management systems.

                I am currently project lead for the <a href="https://getlaminas.org">Laminas Project</a>,
                the open source continuation of <a href="https://framework.zend.com/">Zend
                Framework</a>. I began developing on Zend Framework before its
                first public release, and led the project from 2009 through 2019,
                during which time we released two more major versions, and spun off
                the <a href="https://apigility.org">Apigility</a> (now <a href="https://api-tools.getlaminas.org">Laminas API Tools</a>)
                and <a href="https://getexpressive.org">Expressive</a> (now <a href="https://docs.mezzio.dev">Mezzio</a>)
                projects.

                I am a founding member of the <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/">PHP Framework Interop Group (PHP-FIG)</a>,
                a group creating and promoting standards for the PHP ecosystem. I
                was voted to the inaugural Core Committee, and am currently serving
                my second term in that body.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                I contribute to a number of open source projects, blog on
                PHP-related topics, and present talks and tutorials related to PHP
