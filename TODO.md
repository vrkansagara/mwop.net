# TODO

## Fixes

- [ ] Add "text-center" class to "article" element on comics page

## New features

- [ ] Blog
  - [ ] Add media capabilities
    - [ ] Tooling to search for CC media based on post keywords
    - [ ] Include media in blog post as a banner with the title
    - [ ] Social media integration (Twitter cards, Facebook open graph, etc.)
- [ ] Github
  - [ ] Re-create PuSH functionality to have it update my feed(s)?
    Basically, I could have the initial deploy grab data from GitHub.
    A webhook would then get any updates and choose whether or not to update the internal feed.
    That way, instead of polling, I just get updates.
- [ ] API
  - [ ] Tweet latest blog post entry
